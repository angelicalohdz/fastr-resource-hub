## Content Location - Single Source of Truth

**All content lives in the `methodology/` folder only.**

The `methodology/` folder is the **single source of truth** for all FASTR content. Content written here is then:
1. Published to the documentation website
2. Extracted into slides for workshop presentations

Do NOT add or edit content in:
- `core_content/` - this is auto-generated from methodology files
- `workshops/` - these only contain configuration, not content
- `templates/` - structural templates only

## How the System Works

```
methodology/*.md  →  Documentation website
       ↓
       →  Extracted to core_content/ (via tools/00_extract_slides.py)
              ↓
              →  Combined into workshop decks (via tools/02_build_deck.py)
```

## File Structure in methodology/

Each methodology file has two parts:

1. **Documentation section** (top): Full explanations for the website
2. **Slide section** (after ASCII separator): Condensed content for workshops, marked with `<!-- SLIDE:xxx -->` tags

When adding new content, add it to the appropriate methodology file in both sections if it should appear on both the website and in workshop slides.
