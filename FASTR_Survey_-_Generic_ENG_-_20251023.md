About the survey

The Global Financing Facility for Women, Children, and Adolescents
([GFF](https://www.globalfinancingfacility.org/)) supports country-led
efforts to improve the timely use of data for decision-making,
ultimately leading to stronger primary healthcare (PHC) systems and
better reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and
nutrition (RMNCAH-N) outcomes. This survey is one component of the GFF's
approach to rapid-cycle analytics under the Frequent Assessments and
System Tools for Resilience
([FASTR](https://data.gffportal.org/key-theme/rapid-cycle-analytics-and-data-use))
initiative.

The objectives of the rapid-cycle health facility phone survey are to:

1.  Monitor service availability, readiness, and functioning of primary
    health care (PHC) facilities over time, with an emphasis on
    reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and
    nutrition services.

2.  Characterize and assess the effect of shocks on PHC functioning and
    the ability of health facilities to respond to shocks while
    maintaining essential services.

3.  Inform and assess the implementation of interventions for stronger,
    more resilient PHC systems that support the wellbeing of women,
    children, and adolescents.

4.  Enhance the timeliness and adaptive nature of health facility
    surveys by supplementing existing, large-scale in-person surveys
    with a rapid-cycle, phone-based approach.

Tool design and indicators:

-   Indicators measure health facility components of the [Primary Health
    Care Measurement
    Framework](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240044210)
    developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF (2022),
    with particular attention to services across the RMNCAH-N continuum
    and with consideration to gender and equity.

-   Questions are aligned with and drawn from existing health facility
    survey tools including the WHO's [Harmonized Health Facility
    Assessment](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060289),
    the WHO's [Service Availability and Readiness
    Assessment](https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/service-availability-and-readiness-assessment-(sara)#:~:text=The%20Service%20Availability%20and%20Readiness,managing%20of%20a%20health%20system.),
    the World Bank's [Service Delivery
    Indicators](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/service-delivery-indicators)
    (SDI) Health Facility Survey, the Demographic and Health Surveys
    (DHS) Program's [Service Provision
    Assessment](https://dhsprogram.com/methodology/Survey-Types/SPA.cfm),
    and USAID MOMENTUM's [Modular Health Facility
    Assessment](https://usaidmomentum.org/resource/modular-hfa/).

-   The tool is designed to be administered via a phone-based interview
    to facility managers/Officers in Charge. The target interview time
    is 30 minutes.

-   The tool is designed to be completed over the course of four
    quarterly contacts a year with a representative panel sample of PHC
    facilities. The tool's modular design allows for both country
    adaptation and round-to-round adaptation. Adaptation instructions
    are located at the end of the tool.

Interpreting the tool:

-   Color code in the \"QID\" column indicates objective-specific
    questions:

    -   Dark grey questions are metadata to be completed by the
        enumerator before the survey begins.

    -   White questions are objective questions related to routine
        service delivery and readiness capabilities (Objective 1 & 3)

    -   Orange questions are perception questions related to service
        delivery challenges (Objective 1, 2, & 3)

    -   Pink questions are related to health shocks and their effects on
        various health systems characteristics (Objective 2 & 3)

    -   Light grey rows are optional questions related to either routine
        health systems strengthening or specific RMCAH services, gender,
        and equity considerations. These can be added into the survey
        depending on country needs. QIDs marked in green have an
        explicit gender focus.

-   The notes section contains important information, including:

    -   How frequently the question is asked. Annual questions will be
        asked once a year and quarterly questions will be asked four
        times a year.

    -   Question specific country adaptation instructions. More detailed
        adaptation instructions for the entire survey are located at the
        end of the tool

Programming the survey tool

**This section is intended for the survey coordinator and/or the data
manager** and should be removed prior to sharing the document with
enumerators. The following set of questions should be programmed by the
person in charge of coding the survey, but it **should not be visible to
enumerators** while they administer the survey. Please note the
following:

-   All variables in the programmed survey, and hence in the datasets,
    should be named **based on the question QIDs** provided in this
    document, and should be in **lowercase**. Capital letters are only
    used in the printed version to facilitate reading the document.

-   The list of health facilities and associated administrative levels,
    i.e. **\[ID_FAC\]**, **\[ID_ADMIN1\]**, **\[ID_ADMIN2\]**, etc.
    should be **preloaded** into the survey tool.

-   The meaning of the following codes should be the same across the
    survey:

    -   -96 = x = Other

    -   -99 = y = Don\'t know

    -   -98 = w = Not applicable

    -   -80 = z = None

-   Whenever the option \"Other\" is selected for a question (i.e., the
    answer either takes the value -96, or 1 for variables ending with
    \"\_X\"), there should be a follow-up question offering to provide
    answer details. The variable corresponding to this follow-up
    question should be named similarly to the initial variable but with
    \"\_OTHER\" added at the end. For example, if the respondent answers
    \"Yes\" to option \"X- Other (specify)\" for question HR_08, then
    there should be a follow-up open-ended/text question named
    \"HR_08_OTHER\" following the HR_08_X variable.

Adapting the survey tool

**This section is intended for the survey coordinator and/or the person
in charge of adapting the tool to the surveyed country\'s context.**
This section should be removed prior to sharing the document with
enumerators.

**General guidance:**

-   Please review all questions in the survey marked with **+Adapt** in
    the notes column of the base survey tool. Specific guidance on what
    to adapt is provided.

    -   Notes highlighted in yellow: high priority questions for country
        adaptation

    -   Notes highlighted in blue: additional questions that may require
        country adaptation

-   Additional modules are provided at the end of the base tool, after
    these instructions. These can be added into the survey in a new
    round or can replace one of the standard modules.

-   New questions can be added to ensure the survey meets specific
    country objectives. The GFF Secretariat is available to support the
    development of new survey questions and/or to complete a technical
    review of country-drafted questions to ensure feasibility of
    phone-based data collection and data quality.

-   The approximate time to administer each survey module is provided on
    the base tool. This is an approximation and will vary based on the
    interviewer, respondent, and the skip patterns.

    -   The target time to administer the survey is 30 minutes; the
        maximum length of survey administration should not exceed 45
        minutes. This is important to reduce respondent fatigue and
        improve the quality and accuracy of the data.

**Please use the following guidelines when adapting the survey tool:**

-   Any modification to the survey tool must be recorded in \"track
    changes\" to facilitate reviewing and validating country-specific
    edits and to facilitate easy programming of the tool.

-   If a question is rephrased such that its original meaning is
    significantly altered, the new question should be given a different
    QID (i.e., a different variable name in the final datasets).

-   If a new question is added to the survey, its QID should be chosen
    based on the following set of rules (see the illustrative example
    below):

    -   The new QID (i.e., variable name) needs to end with the
        country\'s Alpha-2 ISO code (see the ISO 3166-1 classification:
        <https://www.iban.com/country-codes>)

    -   If the question is included between two existing questions: a
        letter (A-Z) should be added to the variable name

    -   If the question is included at the end of a section: increase
        the question number by +1.

-   When new answer choices (in the \"Response\" column) are added, the
    values attached to existing answer choices should not be modified.
    The new answer choices should start with the country's numeric code
    (see the ISO 3166-1 classification:
    <https://www.iban.com/country-codes>). If the numeric code starts
    with one or multiple zeros, those leading zeros should be removed
    from the country code.

-   Specify appropriate facility types for specific questions in the
    Relevance/conditions column of the survey tool.

**Illustrative example of a question inclusion**

Country: Antigua and Barbuda

Code ISO-2: **AG**

Numeric code: **028**
