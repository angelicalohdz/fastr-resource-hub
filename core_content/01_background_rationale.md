# What is FASTR?

A data-driven framework developed by the GFF to help countries monitor and improve maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health services.

FASTR strengthens the use of routine health facility data by applying standardized methods for data quality assessment, trend analysis, coverage estimation, and decision-focused interpretation.

### FASTR supports governments to:

- Identify data quality gaps and strengthen HMIS use
- Track service performance and disruptions in near real time
- Generate actionable insights for planning, budgeting, and program improvement


**FASTR provides a practical, analytic pathway for turning routine health data into reliable, policy-relevant insights.**

## The Challenge FASTR Addresses

Health systems generate a lot of data, but each source comes with limitations that make it hard to build a clear, reliable picture of service performance.

- **Routine facility data (e.g., DHIS2)** provide continuous monthly reporting,  
  but suffer from issues like incomplete submission, outliers, and internal inconsistencies.

- **Household surveys (e.g., DHS, MICS)** offer strong methodological rigor,  
  but are infrequent and cannot capture short-term changes.

- **Population and demographic estimates (e.g., UNWPP, national projections)** are needed to understand the size of the groups we aim to serve,  
  but these estimates differ across sources and come with uncertainty.

---
### FASTR introduces a structured analytic approach to **clean, adjust, reconcile, and integrate** these data streams—producing a coherent, decision-ready view of service utilisation and coverage that supports continuous monitoring between survey rounds.

## What Does FASTR Do?

<br>**FASTR is a structured pipeline that transforms routine facility data into reliable, decision-ready insights.**

1. **Diagnoses data quality**  
   Identifies gaps in completeness, detects outliers, and checks consistency.

2. **Improves the data**  
   Applies transparent, reproducible adjustments to correct quality issues.

3. **Analyzes service patterns**  
   Detects disruptions, quantifies changes over time, and strengthens trend signals.

4. **Generates coverage estimates**  
   Integrates adjusted DHIS2 data with surveys and population estimates to produce coherent coverage trends.

---
## What this enables

<br>Countries can use their routine data to **monitor service performance and coverage between survey rounds** with clearer, more reliable signals.
