## What is the FASTR Analytical Lab approach?

<br>The FASTR Analytical Lab is a hands-on, structured process that helps country teams learn how to analyse routine health facility data, interpret the results together, and use the findings to guide decisions each quarter.

<br>The Lab focuses on:
- Asking the right questions  
- Running analysis using FASTR methods  
- Reviewing and interpreting results  
- Deciding what actions follow
