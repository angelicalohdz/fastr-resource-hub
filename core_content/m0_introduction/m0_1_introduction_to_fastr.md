<div>

The Global Financing Facility (GFF) supports country-led efforts to strengthen the use of timely data for decision-making, with the goal of improving primary healthcare (PHC) performance and RMNCAH-N outcomes.

**Frequent Assessments and Health System Tools for Resilience (FASTR)** is the GFF's rapid-cycle analytics framework for monitoring health system performance using high-frequency data.

FASTR brings together four complementary technical approaches:

1. Routine HMIS data analysis
2. Health facility phone surveys
3. High-frequency household phone surveys
4. Follow-on, problem-driven analyses
