## Introduction to FASTR

The Global Financing Facility (GFF) supports country-led efforts to improve the timely use of data for decision-making, ultimately leading to stronger primary healthcare (PHC) systems and better reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) outcomes.

This set of initiatives and technical support is referred to as **Frequent Assessments and Health System Tools for Resilience (FASTR)**.
