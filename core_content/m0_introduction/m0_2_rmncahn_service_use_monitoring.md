## What FASTR does with routine HMIS data

<div class="columns">
<div>

FASTR works directly with Ministries of Health to transform routine HMIS data into actionable evidence for policy and program management.

Using facility-level data, the approach focuses on three core analytic functions:

**Assess data quality**
Identify key issues related to completeness, outliers, and internal consistency.

**Adjust for data quality limitations**
Apply transparent, indicator-specific methods to improve the reliability of trend analysis.

**Analyze service use and coverage trends**
Track changes in priority RMNCAH-N services and compare progress against country priorities and benchmarks.
