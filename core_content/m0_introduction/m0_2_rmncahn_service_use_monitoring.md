## RMNCAH-N service use monitoring

The GFF collaborates with Ministries of Health to conduct rapid-cycle analyses of routine health management information system (HMIS) data. This approach addresses three core objectives:

1. **Assess data quality** at national and sub-national levels to identify and address completeness, accuracy, and consistency issues
2. **Track service utilization changes** by measuring monthly shifts in priority RMNCAH-N health service volumes
3. **Monitor coverage progress** by comparing service delivery trends against country-specific targets and benchmarks
