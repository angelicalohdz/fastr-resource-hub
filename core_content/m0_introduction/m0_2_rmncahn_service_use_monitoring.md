## RMNCAH-N Service Use Monitoring

The GFF collaborates with Ministries of Health to conduct rapid-cycle analyses of routine health management information system (HMIS) data. This approach addresses three core objectives:

1. **Assess data quality** at national and sub-national levels to identify and address completeness, accuracy, and consistency issues
2. **Track service utilization changes** by measuring monthly shifts in priority RMNCAH-N health service volumes
3. **Monitor coverage progress** by comparing service delivery trends against country-specific targets and benchmarks

These analyses focus on priority indicators tied to national health reforms and World Bank investments, with findings informing country planning processes and project implementation cycles. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the GFF supported Ministries of Health in over 20 countries to monitor the impact of the pandemic on essential health services using this approach.
