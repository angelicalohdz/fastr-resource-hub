## Why rapid-cycle analytics?

Existing health systems data sources are critical but often come with challenges that limit their use. Health management information system data may not be analyzed promptly or may be perceived as too low-quality to use for decision making. Traditional in-person household and facility-based surveys demand extensive resources and time, with long lags between survey design, data collection, and the availability of findings. This prevents decision-makers from using data to drive meaningful improvements in health outcomes. To fill this gap, the GFF supports countries to develop and use rapid-cycle analytic approaches.

### How does it work?

Rapid-cycle analytic approaches provide timely, rigorous, and high-priority data that respond to each country's specific priorities and data use needs. This continuous cycle of analyze-learn-strengthen-act seeks to improve the systematic use of data for decision-making towards improved RMNCAH-N outcomes.
