## Why rapid-cycle analytics?

<div class="columns">
<div>

Routine health information systems are a critical source of data, but they are often underused due to concerns about data quality and long delays between data collection and analysis. Traditional household and facility surveys, while essential, are resource-intensive and infrequent.

FASTR's rapid-cycle analytics address this gap by providing:

- Timely insights aligned with country decision cycles
- Continuous learning rather than one-off assessments
- Direct feedback loops between data, analysis, and action

During the COVID-19 pandemic, this approach was applied in over 20 countries to monitor disruptions to essential RMNCAH-N services and inform response and recovery planning.
