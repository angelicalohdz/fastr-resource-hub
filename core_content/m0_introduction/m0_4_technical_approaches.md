## Focus of the analysis

### Core indicators

FASTR prioritizes a core set of RMNCAH-N indicators that:

- Represent key service delivery contacts across the continuum of care
- Have relatively high reporting completeness and volumes
- Serve as proxies for broader service delivery performance

Outpatient consultations are included as a proxy for overall health service use. The indicator set can be expanded to reflect country-specific priorities.

### Core data quality metrics

Analysis is anchored in a standardized set of data quality metrics, including:

- Reporting completeness
- Extreme value (outlier) detection
- Consistency across related indicators

These metrics are summarized into an overall data quality score to support interpretation and comparison across areas.
