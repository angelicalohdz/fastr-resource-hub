## Technical approaches: Details

1. **HMIS data analysis** - Assesses data quality, quantifies changes in health service volumes, and compares coverage trends to country targets

2. **Health facility phone surveys** - Assesses PHC performance, monitors reforms, and tracks changes over quarterly contacts

3. **Household phone surveys** - Captures care-seeking behavior, financial protection, and patient experience (with World Bank LSMS)

4. **Follow-on analyses** - Root cause analysis to explain performance variation and investigate data quality issues
