## FASTR approach to routine data analysis

The FASTR approach follows a three-step workflow:

### 1. Assess data quality
Identify issues related to completeness, outliers, and internal consistency at national and subnational levels.

### 2. Adjust for data quality limitations
Apply transparent, indicator-specific corrections to improve the reliability of trend analysis.

### 3. Analyze service delivery
Quantify changes in priority service volumes and compare coverage trends against country targets.

This enables continuous, subnational monitoring while data quality is systematically improved.
