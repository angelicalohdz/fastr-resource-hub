## Defining priority questions

Effective data use relies on well-defined questions. Priority questions will guide the FASTR analysis and enhance decision making support.

**Qualities of a good question:**

- **Addresses a priority issue**: A topic of interest to you and policy makers
- **Relevant**: Important enough to be worth answering
- **Related to experiences that are alive**: Connected to current issues
- **Important to individuals/groups**: Matters to stakeholders
- **Answerable**: Can be addressed with available data and methods
