## Why focus on high volume indicators?

One key added-value of the FASTR approach is making adjustments for data quality. Low-volume indicators are challenging to adjust:

- **Greater sensitivity to outliers**: A single unusually high or low data point can disproportionately impact overall analysis
- **Unstable estimates**: Small variations can lead to large percentage changes, making it harder to distinguish genuine trends from random variability
- **Difficulty identifying true outliers**: Challenging to determine whether a data point is genuinely an outlier or part of natural variability

Count indicators allow for ongoing data quality checks with improved precision in identifying outliers.
