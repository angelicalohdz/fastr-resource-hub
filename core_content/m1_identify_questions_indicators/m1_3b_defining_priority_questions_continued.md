## Why focus on high completeness indicators?

High completeness indicators improve data quality, reduce bias, and enable more accurate insights:

- **Data reliability**: Data is representative of the full picture across facilities, regions, or populations
- **Consistency in analysis**: Data points from most or all reporting units allow for consistent analysis across time periods and locations
- **Reduced risk of misinterpretation**: Incomplete data can lead to incorrect conclusions (e.g., low completeness might falsely suggest a drop in service utilization)

Statistical methods such as imputation can adjust for incomplete data, but this requires assumptions about the missing data.
