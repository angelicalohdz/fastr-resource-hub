## Why focus on count indicators?

**Challenges with proportion indicators:**
- Proportions limit our ability to apply adjustments for data quality challenges
- Numerators may have data quality challenges, skewing actual coverage levels
- Denominators may be outdated or inaccurate
- Using numerators and denominators separately allows adjustments to both

**Mortality as a rare event:**
- Mortality indicators are inherently low-frequency, making proportional adjustments unreliable
- Better suited for annual reviews than monthly or quarterly updates
