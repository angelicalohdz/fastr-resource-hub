## FASTR core indicators

The FASTR approach focuses on a core set of RMNCAH-N indicators that:
- Characterize the reproductive, maternal and child healthcare continuum
- Capture key service delivery events with higher completeness rates and higher volume
- Serve as proxies for other services delivered at the same contact

Outpatient consultations (OPDs) are used as a proxy for general use of health services.

Additional country and program-specific indicators can be added to be responsive to country priorities.
