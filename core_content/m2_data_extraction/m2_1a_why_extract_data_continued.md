## Why extract data from DHIS2?

### Analysis complexity

The FASTR approach uses more advanced statistical methods, such as regression analysis, which are not available in DHIS2. While DHIS2 can plot trends over time using raw data, FASTR can go further by:

- Identifying significant increases or decreases in service volume
- Adjusting for data quality issues
- Accounting for expected seasonal variations
- Comparing key periods, such as before and after a reform

The choice between DHIS2 and the FASTR approach should be guided by the specific purpose of your analysis.
