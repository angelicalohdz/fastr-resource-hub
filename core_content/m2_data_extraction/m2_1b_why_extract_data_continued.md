## Data format and granularity

Data should be downloaded for each **indicator of interest**, at **facility level**, and **monthly** for the **period of interest**.

- Data should be saved in **long format** meaning each row represents a single observation or measurement
- Data should be saved in **.csv format** and can be saved in either a single .csv file or multiple .csv files

### Why monthly facility level data?

We want to use the most granular data we have access to in order to make more fine tuned assessments for data quality. Using monthly facility level data allows us to conduct the most robust analysis.
