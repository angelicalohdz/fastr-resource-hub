## How much data?

### Initial FASTR analysis
- Download approximately **five years** of historical data
- Exact period depends on data availability and consistency in indicator definitions

### Routine update to FASTR analysis
- Download new data covering the most recent months not previously included (usually **three months** for quarterly implementation)
- Include the **three preceding months** as recent data is often subject to changes due to late reporting or data quality adjustments
