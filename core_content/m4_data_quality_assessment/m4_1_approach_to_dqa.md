## Data quality assessment

Understanding the reliability of routine health data

## Why talk about data quality?

**The challenge:** Health facilities report data every month, but sometimes:
- Numbers seem too high or too low
- Facilities forget to report
- Related numbers don't match up

**The impact:** Bad data leads to bad decisions
- We might think services are improving when they're not
- We might miss real problems in certain areas
- Resources might go to the wrong places

**FASTR's solution:** Check data quality systematically, fix what we can, and be transparent about limitations

## Three simple questions about data quality

**1. Are facilities reporting regularly?**
- Completeness: Did we get reports from facilities this month?

**2. Are the numbers reasonable?**
- Outliers: Are there any suspiciously high values?

**3. Do related numbers make sense together?**
- Consistency: Do related services show expected patterns?

These three questions help us understand if we can trust the data for decision-making.
