## Putting It All Together: Overall Data Quality

---

## Overall Quality Score

**For each facility and month, we combine all three checks:**

**Complete:** Did the facility report?
**No outliers:** Are the numbers reasonable?
**Consistent:** Do related numbers make sense?

**If all three pass -> Quality Score = 1 (good quality)**
**If any fail -> Quality Score = 0 (quality issue)**

**This score helps us:**
- Decide which data to use for analysis
- Identify facilities that need support
- Track if data quality is improving over time
