## Adjustment for outliers

For each value flagged as an outlier, the module calculates what the value "should have been" based on that facility's historical pattern.

**Methods used (in order of preference):**
1. Centered 6-month rolling average (3 months before + 3 months after)
2. Forward 6-month rolling average
3. Backward 6-month rolling average
4. Same month from the previous year (for seasonal indicators)
5. Facility-specific historical mean (fallback)
