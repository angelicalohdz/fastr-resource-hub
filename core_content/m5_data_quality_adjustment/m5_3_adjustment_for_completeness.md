# Adjustment for Completeness

---

## How We Fill Missing Data

**For missing reports:**
- Don't leave them as zero (that would make it look like services stopped)
- **Estimate what the value probably was**
- Use the facility's typical value from nearby months

**Example:**
- Jan: 45 malaria tests
- **Feb: No report (missing)**
- Mar: 48 malaria tests

**Estimated February value:** Average of nearby months = 47 tests

This prevents gaps from creating false "drops" in service delivery.

## "What if our data quality is really bad?"

**FASTR can still help:**

**First: Understand HOW bad**
- The assessment shows exactly where problems are
- Completeness, outliers, consistency by area and indicator
- This guides improvement efforts

**Second: Use what you can**
- Even partial data is better than no data
- Focus on areas/indicators with better quality
- Track improvement over time

**Third: Set realistic expectations**
- Coverage estimates will have more uncertainty
- Trend directions still useful even if exact numbers uncertain
- Transparency about limitations builds trust

## How to Use Data Quality Information

---

## For Program Managers

**Three questions to ask:**

1. **Can we trust this data for decision-making?**
   - Check the quality scores for your area
   - If most months have good quality -> yes, use it
   - If quality is poor -> dig deeper before making decisions

2. **Which areas need data quality support?**
   - Low completeness -> facilities need reporting support
   - Many outliers -> need better data entry or validation
   - Consistency problems -> need training on indicator definitions

3. **Is data quality improving?**
   - Track quality scores over time
   - See if interventions (training, digitization) are working

## For Data Analysts

**How to use the quality outputs:**

**For analysis:**
- Use the adjusted datasets (version 4 typically)
- Filter to high-quality months if needed
- Report which version you used

**For data quality improvement:**
- Share outlier lists with facilities for correction
- Identify facilities with chronic quality problems
- Prioritize areas for in-person data quality assessments

**For reporting:**
- Always mention data quality caveats
- Show before/after adjustment comparisons
- Be transparent about limitations

## Key Takeaways

---

## Remember These Points

**1. Data quality matters for decision-making**
- Bad data -> bad decisions
- Systematic checking prevents mistakes

**2. Three simple dimensions to check**
- Completeness: Are facilities reporting?
- Outliers: Are numbers reasonable?
- Consistency: Do related numbers match?

**3. We can both report and adjust**
- Transparency about problems
- Statistical fixes where appropriate
- Multiple versions for flexibility

**4. Use quality information strategically**
- For analysis: Choose appropriate data version
- For improvement: Target support where needed
- For reporting: Be transparent about limitations

## What's Next?

**Now that we have quality-assessed and adjusted data, we can:**

**Disruption Detection:** Analyze service delivery trends
- Detect disruptions in services
- Quantify shortfalls and surpluses
- Monitor health system performance

**Coverage Analysis:** Estimate population coverage
- What percentage of people are being reached?
- Are we meeting targets?
- Where are the gaps?

**The data quality work enables everything else!**
