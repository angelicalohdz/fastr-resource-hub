# Monitoring Service Delivery Trends

Detecting when health services are disrupted and measuring the impact

---

## Why Monitor Service Trends?

**The question:** Are health services being delivered consistently over time?

**Why it matters:**
- Services might drop during strikes, outbreaks, or supply shortages
- Services might surge during campaigns or after reforms
- We need to know when changes happen and how big they are

**FASTR helps you:**
- Spot when services deviate from normal patterns
- Measure how many services were missed (or exceeded)
- Identify which areas are most affected

---

## What We Mean by "Service Disruption"

**A disruption is when service delivery is significantly different from what we'd normally expect.**

**Examples of disruptions:**
- **Negative:** ANC visits drop by 30% during a health worker strike
- **Positive:** Vaccination rates surge during a catch-up campaign
- **Sustained:** Deliveries remain low for 6 months due to facility closure

**Not a disruption:**
- Small month-to-month variation (normal fluctuation)
- Predictable seasonal patterns (like malaria during rainy season)

---

## Two Key Questions FASTR Answers

**Question 1: WHEN did disruptions happen?**
- Which months showed unusual patterns?
- Were disruptions one-time events or sustained over months?

**Question 2: HOW MUCH was the impact?**
- How many services were missed during disruptions?
- What percentage drop occurred?
- Which areas had the biggest shortfalls?

**Together:** Identify problems + quantify their size = better targeted responses

## How FASTR Detects Disruptions

---

## Step 1: Understanding "Normal"

**Before we can spot problems, we need to know what's normal for each area and service.**

**FASTR looks at historical patterns:**
- What's the typical number of ANC visits in Province X each month?
- Is there a seasonal pattern? (Some services naturally higher in certain months)
- Is there a long-term trend? (Services increasing or decreasing over time)

**Example:**
- Province A normally has 800-900 ANC1 visits per month
- Slightly higher in dry season (better access)
- Gradually increasing trend (+2% per year)

---

## Step 2: Comparing Actual to Expected

**Once we know what's "normal," we compare actual service delivery to what we'd expect.**

**Example - Province A ANC1:**

| Month | Expected | Actual | Difference |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| Jan | 850 | 840 | -10 (normal variation) |
| Feb | 870 | 870 | 0 (right on track) |
| **Mar** | **860** | **620** | **-240** (**disruption**) |
| Apr | 880 | 890 | +10 (normal variation) |

**March shows a large drop** - this flags as a potential disruption needing investigation.

## Different Types of Disruptions

**FASTR looks for several disruption patterns:**

**1. Sharp drop or spike**
- One month with a very large change
- Example: Strike causes ANC to drop 40% in one month

**2. Gradual decline**
- Services slowly dropping over several months
- Example: Stock-outs cause steady decrease in deliveries

**3. Sustained low period**
- Services consistently below normal for months
- Example: Facility closure keeps immunizations low for 6 months

**4. Sustained surge**
- Services consistently above normal
- Example: Campaign boosts vaccination rates for 3 months

## Real Example: COVID-19 Disruption

**Country X - Institutional Deliveries:**

**Before COVID (Jan-Feb 2020):**
- Expected: ~10,000 deliveries/month
- Actual: 9,800-10,200 (normal range)

**During First Wave (Mar-Jun 2020):**
- Expected: ~10,000 deliveries/month
- Actual: 7,500-8,000 (**sustained disruption**)
- Impact: ~2,500 missed deliveries per month

**Recovery (Jul-Dec 2020):**
- Gradually returned toward normal
- By December: 9,500 deliveries

**FASTR detected:** When disruption started, its magnitude, and when recovery began.

## Common Questions

---

## "How do you know what 'expected' should be?"

**We use your own historical data:**

- Look at past 2-3 years of data for each area
- Account for seasonal patterns (some months naturally higher/lower)
- Account for long-term trends (gradual increases/decreases)
- Each area has its own "normal" based on its own history

**Example:**
- Rural clinic's "normal": 50 deliveries/month
- Urban hospital's "normal": 500 deliveries/month
- Each compared to its own baseline, not to each other

---

## "What if services are always low - is that a disruption?"

**No - disruption means a CHANGE from the usual pattern.**

**If services have always been low:**
- That's a chronic access problem, not a disruption
- Important issue but requires different response (system strengthening)

**A disruption is:**
- Services that WERE at some level
- Then DROP (or increase) significantly
- Compared to their own baseline

**Both matter** - but disruption detection helps you spot new/emerging problems distinct from existing chronic issues.

---

## "Could this just be a reporting problem?"

**Yes, sometimes! That's why data quality work (Module 1-2) comes first.**

**FASTR helps distinguish:**

**Real service disruption:**
- Affects multiple related indicators (ANC, deliveries, postnatal all drop together)
- Matches known events (strike, outbreak, policy change)
- Persists across months
- Other data sources confirm

**Data quality issue:**
- Only one indicator affected while others normal
- No plausible explanation for drop
- Inconsistent with facility reports or surveys
- Returns to normal next month with no intervention

**Always cross-check with program knowledge and other data sources.**

---

## "What about normal seasonal variation?"

**FASTR accounts for this automatically.**

**Example - Malaria services:**
- Naturally higher during rainy season
- Lower during dry season
- This is NOT flagged as a disruption

**How it works:**
- Looks at seasonal patterns in historical data
- Expects higher malaria in rainy season
- Only flags if it's unusual EVEN accounting for the season

**Example:**
- April usually has 1,000 malaria cases (rainy season)
- This April has only 600 cases
- Flagged as disruption (low even for rainy season)
