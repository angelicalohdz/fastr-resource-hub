## Service utilization analysis

Monitoring changes in the volume of priority health services over time.

> **Example question:** How has ANC1 utilization changed from 2020 to 2024? Which regions have seen the greatest increases or declines?

---

## What we assess

**Service utilization trends:**
- Absolute yearly/quarterly volume for selected services
- Percent change over time
- Comparison across regions

Any year with more than a **10% change** compared to the previous year is flagged for review.

Data can use: raw values, outlier-adjusted, completeness-adjusted, or both adjustments.
