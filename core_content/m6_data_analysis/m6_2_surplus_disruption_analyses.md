## Surplus and disruption analyses

The module detects multiple types of service disruptions:

| Disruption Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Sharp disruptions** | Single months with extreme deviations |
| **Sustained drops** | Gradual declines over several months |
| **Sustained dips** | Periods consistently below expected levels |
| **Sustained rises** | Periods consistently above expected levels |
| **Missing data patterns** | Gaps in reporting that may signal problems |

### Quantifying impact

Disruption analysis quantifies shortfalls and surpluses by comparing:
- **Predicted volumes** (what would have happened without disruption)
- **Actual volumes** (what was observed)

Results are reported in absolute numbers and percentages at each geographic level.
