## Disruption analysis

Beyond simple trends, FASTR can detect and quantify service disruptions.

**How it works:**
1. Model expected service volumes based on historical patterns and seasonality
2. Compare actual volumes to expected volumes
3. Quantify shortfalls or surpluses in absolute numbers

## Types of disruptions detected

| Type | What it captures |
|------|------------------|
| **Sharp disruptions** | Single months with extreme deviations |
| **Sustained drops** | Gradual declines over several months |
| **Sustained dips** | Periods consistently below expected |
| **Sustained rises** | Periods consistently above expected |
