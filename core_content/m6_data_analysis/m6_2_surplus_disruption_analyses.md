# Measuring Disruption Impact: Shortfalls and Surpluses

---

## Calculating Service Shortfalls

**Once we identify a disruption, we measure its impact:**

**Shortfall = Expected Services - Actual Services**

**Example - District Y, March 2023:**
- Expected ANC4 visits: 1,200
- Actual ANC4 visits: 850
- **Shortfall: 350 visits (29% below expected)**

**Interpretation:** District Y missed about 350 ANC4 visits in March - these women didn't complete their antenatal care.

## Shortfalls vs. Surpluses

**Shortfall (negative disruption):**
- Fewer services delivered than expected
- Shows missed opportunities
- Requires catch-up efforts

**Surplus (positive disruption):**
- More services delivered than expected
- Could indicate successful campaign, policy change, or data quality issue
- Need to verify if it's real or a reporting problem

**Example surplus:**
- Vaccination campaign reaches 5,000 children
- Expected only 3,000 based on normal patterns
- Surplus: +2,000 vaccinations (positive outcome!)

## Geographic Detail: National vs. Local

**FASTR analyzes disruptions at multiple levels:**

**National level:**
- Overall country trends
- Big picture of health system performance

**Provincial/regional level:**
- Which provinces are most affected?
- Are disruptions concentrated geographically?

**District level (optional):**
- Most detailed view
- Identifies specific districts needing support

**Why multiple levels?** National trends can mask local problems - one province might be fine while another suffers major disruptions.

## Example: National vs. Provincial View

**National ANC1 (March 2023):**
- Expected: 50,000 visits
- Actual: 48,000 visits
- Shortfall: -2,000 (4% below expected) - **looks minor**

**But breaking down by province:**

| Province | Expected | Actual | Shortfall |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| North | 15,000 | 14,800 | -200 (1%) |
| South | 20,000 | 19,900 | -100 (0.5%) |
| **East** | **15,000** | **13,300** | **-1,700 (11%)** |

**East Province has a serious problem** that's hidden in the national average!

## Interpreting Disruption Results

---

## Key Questions to Ask

**1. Which services are most disrupted?**
- Maternal health? Child health? Specific diseases?
- Are all services affected equally or just certain ones?

**2. When did disruptions occur?**
- Can we link to known events (strikes, campaigns, outbreaks)?
- Are they one-time or ongoing?

**3. Where are disruptions concentrated?**
- Which geographic areas are most affected?
- Urban vs. rural patterns?

**4. How severe are the impacts?**
- How many people missed services?
- What's the percentage change?

---

## Using Results for Decision-Making

**For program managers:**

**Immediate actions:**
- Investigate cause of detected disruptions
- Plan catch-up services for areas with large shortfalls
- Allocate resources to most-affected areas

**Strategic planning:**
- Identify chronic problem areas needing system strengthening
- Evaluate impact of policies or reforms
- Set realistic targets based on actual patterns

**Monitoring:**
- Track whether interventions improve service delivery
- Early warning system for emerging problems

---

## For Data Analysts

**Analysis workflow:**

1. **Review disruption flags:** Which months/areas were flagged?
2. **Examine magnitude:** Are shortfalls large enough to act on?
3. **Check data quality:** Could this be a data reporting issue?
4. **Contextualize:** What events might explain the pattern?
5. **Communicate findings:** Create visualizations and key messages

**Key outputs to share:**
- Lists of disrupted periods by indicator and area
- Shortfall estimates (numbers and percentages)
- Time series graphs showing expected vs. actual
- Maps showing geographic distribution of disruptions

## Key Takeaways

---

## Remember These Points

**1. Disruptions are changes from expected patterns**
- Not about absolute levels, but deviations from normal
- Each area compared to its own baseline

**2. Two-part analysis**
- WHEN: Identify months with unusual patterns
- HOW MUCH: Quantify the impact (shortfalls/surpluses)

**3. Multiple perspectives matter**
- National trends can hide local problems
- Look at provincial and district levels

**4. Context is essential**
- Link disruptions to known events
- Cross-check with data quality assessments
- Verify with program staff and other data

**5. Use for action**
- Identify areas needing support
- Quantify catch-up service needs
- Monitor impact of interventions
