## Example: result vs key takeaway

**Result:**
> In Q3 2022, the volume of ANC1 visits increased by 15% from the previous quarter—the largest quarterly rise in the period—followed by a 12% drop in Q1 2023. Since then, ANC1 volumes have remained relatively stable.

**Key takeaway:**
> The relative stability observed from mid-2023 onward suggests improvements in the consistency of service delivery. This trend may reflect strengthened systems or more predictable care-seeking patterns — providing a stronger foundation for sustained antenatal care coverage.
