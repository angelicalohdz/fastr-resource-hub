## Choosing the right report format

### Key considerations
- **Audience** – Who will be using the report?
- **Purpose** – Inform, persuade, summarize, or analyze?
- **Level of Detail** – High-level summary vs. in-depth analysis
- **Accessibility** – How will the audience access and use it?

| Audience | Format |
|----------|--------|
| Government officials and policymakers | Brief slide deck + executive summary PDF |
| Technical experts and researchers | Full word/PDF report + Data annex |
| General public and advocacy groups | Infographics + posters |
