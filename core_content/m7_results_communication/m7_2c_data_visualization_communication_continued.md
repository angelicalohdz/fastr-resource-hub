## Storytelling with data

Storytelling is a powerful communication tool to help translate data into compelling narratives to guide decision-making.

### Elements of a data story
- **Plot**: What questions will you answer from the data?
- **Setting**: What is the context?
- **Audience**: Who is your target audience?
- **Issue**: What is the main health issue?
- **Implication**: What are the actions/recommendations?

Be creative and remember to tailor the story to your audience.
