## Example: developing a data story

**Setting:** Examining routine data quality is critical to inform targeted action by the Ministry of Health

**Issue:** In Somalia, data quality varies across indicators: ANC4, institutional deliveries and BCG vaccine had fewer outliers, compared to Penta 3 and OPD.

**Context:** Hirshabelle State exhibits poorer data quality with more than 3% outliers for outpatient visits. Puntland State had 2.5% outliers for Penta 3 vaccines.

**Call to action:** Further investigation is needed to identify specific areas/facilities that need attention to improve data quality.
