## Health Facility Assessment Phone Survey

Complementing routine data with facility-level insights

---

## Why phone surveys?

**Routine HMIS data tells us *what* is happening:**
- How many services were delivered
- Which facilities reported
- Where there might be data quality issues

**But HMIS data can't tell us *why*:**
- Is the facility actually open?
- Are essential supplies available?
- Are trained staff present?
- What challenges are facilities facing?

**Phone surveys fill this gap** by contacting facilities directly to understand context.

## FASTR HFA approach

**Rapid:** 15-30 minute phone calls
**Low-cost:** No travel required
**Regular:** Can be repeated quarterly
**Linked:** Connected to routine HMIS data

The goal is timely, actionable information that helps interpret routine data patterns.

## What the survey covers

1. **Is the facility open and functioning?**
2. **Which services are currently available?**
3. **Are essential medicines in stock?**
4. **What staff are present today?**
5. **What challenges is the facility facing?**

Results help explain *why* routine data might show certain patterns.
