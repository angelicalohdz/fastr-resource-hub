## Why adapt the questionnaire?

The standard FASTR questionnaire is a **starting point**, not a final product.

**Every country needs to:**
- Translate into local language(s)
- Use local health system terminology
- Focus on nationally relevant indicators
- Adjust for local facility types
- Match local supply/medicine names

## Adaptation principles

**Keep what matters:**
- Core questions on operational status
- Essential supply availability
- Basic service provision

**Adapt to context:**
- Local terminology and naming
- Country-specific priority services
- Relevant response categories

**Don't add too much:**
- Phone surveys should stay short (15-30 min)
- Focus on actionable information
- Avoid "nice to know" questions
