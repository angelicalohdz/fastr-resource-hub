## Review process

**For each section, ask:**

1. Is this question relevant for our context?
2. Is the wording clear in local language?
3. Are the response options complete?
4. Should we add country-specific items?
5. Can we remove anything non-essential?

**Goal:** A questionnaire that is locally relevant while maintaining comparability with the FASTR standard.
