## Activity overview

**What we'll do:**
Work in groups to adapt the standard FASTR questionnaire to our country context.

**Groups:**

- Group 4: Blocks G-J (Supplies, Leadership, Community, QI)

## Adaptation checklist

For each question in your block:

- [ ] Is the question clear in local language?
- [ ] Are response options appropriate?
- [ ] Should we add country-specific items?
- [ ] Can we simplify without losing information?
- [ ] Does skip logic make sense?

**Document your changes** for group discussion.

## Group discussion

After working in groups, we'll:

1. **Present adaptations** - Each group shares key changes
2. **Discuss trade-offs** - What did we add vs. remove?
3. **Reach consensus** - Agree on final adaptations
4. **Plan pre-testing** - How will we test the adapted questionnaire?
