## HFA priorities and data use

---

## Using survey results

**Phone survey results should inform:**

1. **Routine data interpretation**
   - Explain patterns in HMIS data
   - Validate data quality concerns

2. **Targeted support**
   - Identify facilities needing intervention
   - Prioritize supervision visits

3. **Supply chain management**
   - Track stockout patterns
   - Inform distribution planning

## Linking survey to routine data

**Example use cases:**

| HMIS pattern | Survey question | Insight |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Facility stopped reporting | Is facility open? | Closed vs. reporting failure |
| Sudden drop in services | Stock availability? | Stockout impact |
| Low immunization numbers | Vaccine in stock? | Supply vs. demand issue |

**Goal:** Triangulate multiple data sources for better decision-making.

## Next steps for HFA implementation

1. **Finalize adapted questionnaire**
2. **Train enumerators**
3. **Establish call schedule**
4. **Conduct pilot round**
5. **Analyze and link to HMIS**
6. **Report and use findings**

**Key question:** How will HFA results feed into your routine monitoring and decision-making processes?
