# Health Facility Assessments

---

## Rapid-Cycle Phone Surveys

**What are they?**
Quarterly phone surveys to PHC facilities that assess:
- Service availability
- Service readiness
- Key inputs (staff, equipment, medicines)
- Quality of care indicators

**Why phone surveys?**
- Cost-effective compared to in-person assessments
- Can be conducted quarterly for regular monitoring
- Complement DHIS2 data by providing "readiness" context

## Integration with DHIS2 Analysis

Facility phone surveys help answer the "why" questions that DHIS2 data raises.

**Example:**
- DHIS2 shows declining ANC4 visits in District X
- Phone survey reveals stock-outs of iron/folate supplements
- Action: Targeted support for supply chain in District X

## Key Indicators from Facility Assessments

**Service availability:**
- Which services are offered at each facility level

**Service readiness:**
- Staff availability and training
- Equipment functionality
- Medicine and commodity stock levels
- Infrastructure (water, power, etc.)

**Quality of care:**
- Adherence to protocols
- Patient satisfaction indicators

## Linking Facility Data to Performance

By combining facility assessment data with DHIS2 utilization data, we can:
- Identify whether low utilization is due to supply-side or demand-side factors
- Target interventions to facilities with specific gaps
- Monitor impact of quality improvement initiatives
- Ensure equitable distribution of resources

## Example: BEmONC Readiness

**Question:** Are facilities 'ready' to deliver quality BEmONC services?

**Data needed:**
- Trained staff (phone survey)
- Essential equipment available (phone survey)
- Essential medicines in stock (phone survey)
- Service utilization volume (DHIS2)
- Service quality outcomes (DHIS2 + surveys)
