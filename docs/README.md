## Key Concepts

### Workshop Configuration

Every workshop needs a `config.py` file that defines:
- Basic info (name, date, location, facilitators)
- Which core sections to include (1-7)
- Optional components (breaks, agenda, closing)
- Custom slides to add

**Example:**
```python
WORKSHOP_CONFIG = {
    'workshop_id': '2025_01_nigeria',
    'name': 'FASTR Workshop - Nigeria',
    'sections': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    'include_breaks': True,
    'custom_slides': ['custom_slides.md'],
}
```

---

### Two-Step Build Process

1. **Assemble:** Combine content into markdown
   ```bash
   python3 tools/02_build_deck.py --workshop 2025_01_nigeria
   ```
   Output: `outputs/2025_01_nigeria_deck.md`

2. **Render:** Export to PDF or PowerPoint
   ```bash
   marp outputs/2025_01_nigeria_deck.md --theme-set fastr-theme.css --pdf
   ```
   Output: `outputs/2025_01_nigeria_deck.pdf`

---

### PDF vs PowerPoint

**Use PDF when:**
- Distributing final presentations
- Presenting from your own laptop
- Consistency is critical
- You want perfect FASTR styling

**Use PowerPoint when:**
- Collaborators need to edit after export
- Last-minute changes are likely
- Presenting on unknown computers
- Flexibility is more important than consistency

**Recommendation:** Always create PDF first, use PowerPoint as backup.
