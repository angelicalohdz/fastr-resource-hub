# Content Action Plan: Methodology Modules

Audit of content status across all methodology modules.

---

## Getting Started (Ashley & Angelica)

### Suggested Division of Work

| Person | Focus | Files |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Ashley & Angelica** | Documentation content (detailed explanations) | Top half of each `.md` file |
| **Claire** | Slide content (condensed bullets) | Bottom half (after ASCII separator) |
| **Meghan** | Platform content |  |




### Where to Start

**Recommended first file:** `methodology/01_identify_questions_indicators.md`


### Priority Order

| Priority | Module | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | M1: Questions & Indicators | Foundation for everything else |
| 2 | M7: Results Communication | Ties it all together |
| 3 | M3: FASTR Platform | Technical but important |
| 4 | M2: Data Extraction | Partially done, just needs completion |

---

## Content Creation Strategy

**Approach:** Use AI to extract and adapt content from existing FASTR workshop decks and training materials.

1. Gather existing PowerPoint/PDF decks for each module
2. Use AI to extract relevant content into markdown format
3. Adapt content to fit the methodology documentation structure
4. Content goes into existing SLIDE markers (structure already in place)
5. Review and refine with subject matter experts

The placeholder modules (M1, M3, M7) already have the correct slide marker structure - we just need to fill in the content, not create new markers.

## Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **DRAFTED** | Content exists, needs review and sign-off |
| **PARTIAL** | Some content exists, more needed |
| **PLACEHOLDER** | Module structure exists but no real content - needs full creation |
