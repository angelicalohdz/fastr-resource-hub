# Content Action Plan: Methodology Modules

Audit of content status across all methodology modules.

> **Note:** This is a suggested action plan for team discussion. The content needs and priorities listed here are initial recommendations - the team should review together and adjust based on actual requirements.

---

## Content Creation Strategy

**Approach:** Use AI to extract and adapt content from existing FASTR workshop decks and training materials.

1. Gather existing PowerPoint/PDF decks for each module
2. Use AI to extract relevant content into markdown format
3. Adapt content to fit the methodology documentation structure
4. Add SLIDE markers for workshop presentation extraction
5. Review and refine with subject matter experts
