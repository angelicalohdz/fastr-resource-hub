# Identify Questions & Indicators

This module guides the process of identifying the right questions and indicators for FASTR implementation.

## Overview

*Full documentation content to be developed*

This section will cover the complete process of:

1. **Introduction to FASTR: Gaps and Challenges** - Identifying gaps and challenges that FASTR is well suited to support, how FASTR serves as an entry point to reduce fragmentation, and starting the conversation with government stakeholders

2. **Development of a Data Use Case** - Co-creation workshop approach with MoH and stakeholders, data use case development guidance, and example use cases from country implementations

3. **Defining Priority Questions and Selecting Indicators** - How to define priority questions for FASTR analysis, criteria for selecting indicators, what makes a good FASTR indicator, and aligning indicators with national strategies

## Defining Priority Questions

Effective data use relies on well-defined questions. Priority questions will guide the FASTR analysis and can enhance decision making support.

**Qualities of a good question include:**

- **Addresses a priority issue**: Select a topic of interest to you and policy makers
- **Relevant**: Important enough to be worth answering
- **Related to experiences that are alive**: Connected to current issues and concerns
- **Important to individuals/groups**: Matters to stakeholders
- **Answerable**: Can be addressed with available data and methods

### Is My Question a Relevant Priority? 5+ Ws to Consider

- **Who** is your audience?
- **What** do they need and want to know?
- **When** do they need to know it by?
- **When** is the event/intervention/period they are interested in?
- **Why** do they need to know?
- **How** will they use the findings?

### What Do We Mean by Answerable?

**We have the data**
- Type, quantity, quality sufficient for the question

**We have the analysis tools/methods**
- Statistically valid; feasible to use

**We have the time**
- We can answer the question on a quarterly basis

### PICO Framework for Identifying Answerable Questions

The PICO framework is a standard tool from evidence-based medicine and public health research for formulating clear, answerable questions.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **P**opulation | Who is being investigated - define the target group |
| **I**ntervention | What is being investigated - focus on services or public health actions |
| **C**omparison | What is baseline/non-intervention - relevant comparisons if applicable |
| **O**utcome | What is public health objective - expected changes or impacts |

## Selecting Indicators: What Makes a Good Indicator for FASTR Analysis?

When selecting indicators for FASTR analysis, consider the following criteria:

- **Relevance**: Does this indicator provide data that aligns with our priority questions and objectives?
- **Volume**: Is this indicator collected at a high volume, which improves the robustness of analysis?
- **Completeness**: Does the indicator have a high completeness rate across reporting facilities?
- **Frequency**: Is the indicator reported frequently enough (e.g., monthly) to support rapid-cycle analysis?
- **Type**: Is this indicator a count of services delivered?

### Why Focus on High Volume Indicators?

One key added-value of the FASTR approach is making adjustments for data quality. Low-volume indicators are challenging to adjust:

- **Greater Sensitivity to Outliers**: In low-volume data, a single unusually high or low data point can disproportionately impact the overall analysis. Adjusting for outliers in low-volume indicators may result in artificial fluctuations that do not accurately reflect real trends.
- **Unstable Estimates**: Low-volume indicators are often less reliable because small variations can lead to large percentage changes, making it harder to distinguish genuine trends from random variability.
- **Difficulty in Identifying True Outliers**: In low-volume indicators, it's challenging to determine whether a data point is genuinely an outlier or simply part of the natural variability. This uncertainty complicates the adjustment process and may lead to incorrect assumptions.

Count indicators allow for ongoing data quality checks, including improved precision in identifying outliers or data issues and flexibility to validate counts before deriving proportions externally.

### Why Focus on High Completeness Indicators?

High completeness indicators are recommended because they improve data quality, reduce bias, and enable more accurate, timely, and actionable insights, ultimately leading to better-informed public health decisions.

- **Data Reliability**: High completeness ensures that data is representative of the full picture across facilities, regions, or populations, reducing the risk of biased insights. This reliability is essential for making confident decisions based on the data.
- **Consistency in Analysis**: With high completeness, you have data points from most or all reporting units, allowing for a more consistent analysis across time periods and locations. This consistency is necessary for identifying accurate trends and making meaningful comparisons.
- **Reduced Risk of Misinterpretation**: Incomplete data can lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, low completeness might falsely suggest a drop in service utilization when, in reality, it's due to missing data. High completeness helps avoid these misinterpretations.

Statistical methods such as imputation can be used to adjust for incomplete data; however, this requires making assumptions about the missing data. See [Data Quality Adjustment](05_data_quality_adjustment.md) for details.

### Why Focus on Count Indicators?

**Challenges with Proportion Indicators:**

- Proportions limit our ability to apply adjustments to account for data quality challenges
- Numerators may have data quality challenges, skewing actual coverage levels
- Denominators may be outdated or inaccurate
- Utilizing numerators and denominators separately to generate proportions allows us to make adjustments to both numerator and denominator

**Mortality as a Rare Event:**

- Mortality indicators are inherently low-frequency, making proportional adjustments unreliable
- Mortality and similar rare events are better suited for annual reviews than frequent (e.g., monthly or quarterly) updates

### FASTR Core Indicators

The FASTR approach to routine data analysis focuses on a core set of RMNCAH-N indicators that characterize the reproductive, maternal and child healthcare continuum across LMICs. These indicators capture key service delivery events with higher completeness rates and higher volume, and serve as proxies for other services and interventions delivered at the same service contact. Outpatient consultations (OPDs) are also used as a proxy for the general use of health services. Additional country and program-specific indicators can be added to the analysis to be responsive to country priorities
