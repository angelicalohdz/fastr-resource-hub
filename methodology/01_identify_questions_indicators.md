## Defining priority questions

Effective use of routine data depends on well-defined analytical questions. Priority questions provide direction for FASTR analyses and help ensure that outputs are relevant and actionable for decision makers.

**Characteristics of a good priority question include:**

- **Addresses a priority issue**  
  Focuses on topics of clear interest to policy makers and program managers.

- **Relevant**  
  Important enough to warrant analysis and to inform decision making.

- **Grounded in current realities**  
  Connected to ongoing challenges, reforms, or shocks affecting service delivery.

- **Meaningful to stakeholders**  
  Addresses issues that matter to specific individuals or groups involved in planning or implementation.

- **Answerable**  
  Can be addressed using available data, methods, and timeframes.

### Assessing relevance: key questions to consider

When assessing whether a question is a priority, the following considerations are useful:

- **Who** is the intended audience?  
- **What** do they need or want to know?  
- **When** do they need the information?  
- **Which period or event** is of interest?  
- **Why** is this information needed?  
- **How** will the findings be used?

### What do we mean by “answerable”?

A question is considered answerable if the following conditions are met:

**Data availability**  
- The required data exist and are of sufficient type, quantity, and quality.

**Analytical feasibility**  
- Appropriate and statistically valid methods are available and feasible to apply.

**Timeliness**  
- The analysis can be completed within the required timeframe (e.g., quarterly reporting cycles).

### PICO framework for formulating answerable questions

> **Note:** This framework was included in the original presentation material and is retained here as an optional tool.

The PICO framework, commonly used in public health and evidence-based research, provides a structured way to formulate clear and answerable questions.

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Population** | The population or group of interest |
| **Intervention** | The service, program, or action being examined |
| **Comparison** | The relevant baseline or comparison condition, if applicable |
| **Outcome** | The expected change or public health objective |

## Selecting indicators: what makes a good FASTR indicator?

Indicator selection is critical to the quality and usefulness of FASTR analysis. Indicators should be chosen based on the following criteria:

- **Relevance**  
  The indicator aligns with priority questions and policy objectives.

- **Volume**  
  The indicator is reported at sufficiently high volumes to support robust analysis.

- **Completeness**  
  Reporting completeness is high across facilities and over time.

- **Frequency**  
  The indicator is reported frequently enough (typically monthly) to support rapid-cycle analysis.

- **Type**  
  The indicator represents a count of services delivered.

### Why focus on high-volume indicators?

One of the core strengths of the FASTR approach is its ability to adjust for data quality issues. High-volume indicators are better suited to this process because:

- **Reduced sensitivity to outliers**  
  In low-volume indicators, individual data points can disproportionately affect trends.

- **More stable estimates**  
  High-volume data reduce random variability and improve the reliability of trend detection.

- **Clearer identification of true anomalies**  
  Larger counts make it easier to distinguish genuine outliers from natural variation.

Count indicators also allow for ongoing validation and adjustment before proportions or coverage measures are derived externally.

### Why focus on high-completeness indicators?

Indicators with high reporting completeness are preferred because they:

- **Improve data reliability**  
  More complete data reduce bias and provide a more representative picture of service delivery.

- **Support consistent analysis**  
  High completeness enables meaningful comparisons across time and geographic areas.

- **Reduce misinterpretation**  
  Incomplete data can falsely suggest changes in service utilization when changes are driven by reporting gaps rather than real trends.

While statistical methods such as imputation can be used to address incomplete data, these methods require assumptions about missing values. Further detail is provided in [Data Quality Adjustment](05_data_quality_adjustment.md).

### Why focus on count indicators?

**Limitations of proportion indicators**

- Proportions limit the ability to adjust numerators and denominators separately for data quality issues.  
- Numerators and denominators may each be affected by different sources of error.  
- Separating counts from denominator estimation allows for more transparent and flexible adjustment.

**Mortality as a rare event**

- Mortality indicators are typically low-frequency and not well suited to frequent adjustment.  
- These indicators are generally better analyzed using annual rather than monthly or quarterly data.

## FASTR core indicators

The FASTR approach focuses on a core set of RMNCAH-N indicators that represent key points along the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition continuum in low- and middle-income countries. These indicators typically have higher reporting volumes and completeness and serve as proxies for broader service delivery patterns.

Outpatient consultations are also included as a proxy for overall health service utilization. Country- or program-specific indicators may be added as needed to reflect national priorities.

## Preparing for data extraction

This step includes a pre-extraction checklist, review of the DHIS2 configuration, mapping of indicators to data elements, and planning of the extraction timeline. These steps ensure that downstream analyses are based on consistent, well-understood inputs.

## What makes a good indicator for FASTR analysis?

- **Relevance**: Does this indicator align with our priority questions and objectives?
- **Volume**: Is this indicator collected at a high volume, improving robustness of analysis?
- **Completeness**: Does the indicator have a high completeness rate across reporting facilities?
- **Frequency**: Is the indicator reported frequently enough (e.g., monthly) to support rapid-cycle analysis?
- **Type**: Is this indicator a count of services delivered?
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m1_3a -->
## Why focus on high volume indicators?

One key added-value of the FASTR approach is making adjustments for data quality. Low-volume indicators are challenging to adjust:

- **Greater sensitivity to outliers**: A single unusually high or low data point can disproportionately impact overall analysis
- **Unstable estimates**: Small variations can lead to large percentage changes, making it harder to distinguish genuine trends from random variability
- **Difficulty identifying true outliers**: Challenging to determine whether a data point is genuinely an outlier or part of natural variability

Count indicators allow for ongoing data quality checks with improved precision in identifying outliers.
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m1_3b -->
## Why focus on high completeness indicators?

High completeness indicators improve data quality, reduce bias, and enable more accurate insights:

- **Data reliability**: Data is representative of the full picture across facilities, regions, or populations
- **Consistency in analysis**: Data points from most or all reporting units allow for consistent analysis across time periods and locations
- **Reduced risk of misinterpretation**: Incomplete data can lead to incorrect conclusions (e.g., low completeness might falsely suggest a drop in service utilization)

Statistical methods such as imputation can adjust for incomplete data, but this requires assumptions about the missing data.
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m1_3c -->
## Why focus on count indicators?

**Challenges with proportion indicators:**
- Proportions limit our ability to apply adjustments for data quality challenges
- Numerators may have data quality challenges, skewing actual coverage levels
- Denominators may be outdated or inaccurate
- Using numerators and denominators separately allows adjustments to both

**Mortality as a rare event:**
- Mortality indicators are inherently low-frequency, making proportional adjustments unreliable
- Better suited for annual reviews than monthly or quarterly updates
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m1_3d -->
## FASTR core indicators

The FASTR approach focuses on a core set of RMNCAH-N indicators that:
- Characterize the reproductive, maternal and child healthcare continuum
- Capture key service delivery events with higher completeness rates and higher volume
- Serve as proxies for other services delivered at the same contact

Outpatient consultations (OPDs) are used as a proxy for general use of health services.

Additional country and program-specific indicators can be added to be responsive to country priorities.
