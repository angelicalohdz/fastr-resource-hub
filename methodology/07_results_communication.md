## Moving from data to key messages

### What is a result?

Results are what the analysis found...

- Data quality scores
- Coverage estimations
- Service utilization numbers

They are often...

- Many in number
- Complex
- Hard to understand 'at a glance'
- Lacking interpretation

### What is a key takeaway?

Key takeaways are what the results are telling us...

- Why the results matter
- The 'so what'

They should be...

- Few in number
- Simple and clear
- Easy to remember
- Actionable

### Example: result vs key takeaway

**Example 1 (Result):**

> In Q3 2022, the volume of ANC1 visits increased by 15% from the previous quarter—the largest quarterly rise in the period—followed by a 12% drop in Q1 2023. Since then, ANC1 volumes have remained relatively stable with no large quarter-to-quarter fluctuations from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025.

**Example 2 (Key Takeaway):**

> While earlier periods show sharp fluctuations in ANC1 service volumes, particularly in 2020 and 2022, the relative stability observed from mid-2023 onward suggests improvements in the consistency of service delivery. This trend may reflect strengthened systems, reduced disruptions, or more predictable care-seeking patterns — providing a stronger foundation for sustained antenatal care coverage.

## Choosing the right report format

### Key considerations

- **Audience** – Who will be using the report?
- **Purpose** – Inform, persuade, summarize, or analyze?
- **Level of Detail** – High-level summary vs. in-depth analysis
- **Accessibility** – How will the audience access and use it?

### Report format options

| Format | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| Word/PDF Reports | Policymakers, technical experts | Detailed, formal, easy to print | Can be dense, not interactive |
| Slide Decks | Presentations, decision-makers | Visual, easy to follow, summary-focused | Less detailed, context can be lost |
| Infographics | General audiences, advocacy | Engaging, digestible, shareable | Limited depth, requires design effort |
| Posters | Conferences, workshops | High impact, visual summary | Not suited for complex data |

### Which format works best?

| Audience | Format |
|----------|--------|
| Government officials and policymakers | Brief slide deck + executive summary PDF |
| Technical experts and researchers | Full word/PDF report + Data annex |
| General public and advocacy groups | Infographics + posters |
| Conference or workshop attendees | Poster + summary slide deck |

## Storytelling with data

Storytelling is a powerful communication tool to help translate data and data visualizations into compelling narratives to guide decision-making and convey important health information.

### The goal of storytelling with data can vary and take various forms

- Explanation of a data visualization
- "Once upon a time story" and what we can learn from it
- "Breaking news story"
- "What happened" story
- Causation or correlation story
- "How" story

### Elements of a data story

- **Plot**: What questions will you answer from the data, and how?
- **Setting**: What is the context?
- **Audience**: Who is your target audience? (Identifying the audience is very important, and will dictate your storytelling)
- **Issue**: What is the main health issue?
- **Implication**: What are the actions/recommendations?

### Storytelling can take different forms

- Can include data visualizations/images
- With or without numbers
- Beginning to end or vice versa; does not need to be in chronological order

Be creative and remember to tailor the story to your audience.

### Example: developing a data story

**Part 1: Introduction and Context**

Setting, audience, why we care:
> Examining routine data quality is critical to inform targeted action by the Ministry of Health

Issue:
> In Somalia, data quality varies across indicators: ANC4, institutional deliveries and BCG vaccine indicators had fewer outliers, compared to Penta 3 and OPD.

Additional data/context to help explain the issue:
> Zooming into specific States, Hirshabelle State exhibits poorer data quality with more than 3% outliers for outpatient visits. Similarly, Puntland State had 2.5% outliers for Penta 3 vaccines.

Call to action:
> Further investigation is needed to identify the specific areas/facilities that need attention to improve data quality of OPD and Penta 3 indicators.

**Part 2: Deeper Analysis (OPD)**

> For outpatient visits, zooming in even further into Hirshabelle and Puntland States suggests that the high proportion of outliers in Hirshabelle State are not spread throughout the State, but rather in specific regions. Hiiraan region requires further investigation to understand reasons for the high 4.7% outliers and to improve data quality.

**Part 3: Deeper Analysis (Penta 3)**

> For Penta 3 immunization, Ayn Region and Ras-Asayr Region in Puntland State need further attention with >6% outliers. Showing disaggregated data is imperative as national and state-level estimates of data quality indicators can mask specific regions requiring further data quality investigation.

## Dissemination and data use roadmap

A data use roadmap is a strategic plan that outlines how data will be utilized, shared, and disseminated effectively. It serves as a guide for ensuring that the analytical product developed reaches its intended audience and achieves its goals.

### Why is developing a dissemination and data use roadmap important?

- Establishes metrics and indicators to evaluate the success of data use
- Clearly identifies key stakeholders, target audiences, and dissemination platforms/forums
- Outlines the steps needed to achieve data dissemination goals
- Anticipates potential challenges and barriers in data dissemination and use and develops strategies to solve for them

### Dissemination and data use roadmap components

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Who is your end user or users?** | Identify target audience | RMNCAH-N national coordination platform |
| **Objectives of your message** | Focus on one specific objective per audience | Facilitate the use of data for decision-making and policy development |
| **Key messages** | Define the core messages you want to communicate | RMNCAH-N trends and identification of lagging districts |
| **Dissemination channels** | Specify existing dissemination channels or forums | Quarterly RMNCAH-N platform meetings |
| **Timeline** | Identify the timeline with key milestones and deadlines | Next platform meeting is in Q2 |
| **Steps required & Who is accountable** | Define steps and assign roles and responsibilities | Get on agenda for platform meeting – Director; Finalize presentation – officer |
| **Monitoring & Evaluation** | How will you know if you are successful? | The % of quarterly reports that were disseminated in relevant forums; A list of actions that were taken as a result of the data is created and maintained |

## Action plan for FASTR moving forward

An action plan will help guide FASTR activities at the country level over the next year. Consider:

**Your use cases**
- Is there anything you want to change or add to your data use case?

**Report finalization**
- Is the report you made at the workshop the one you want to use moving forward? If not, how will you finalize your report?

**The process for continuously updating and disseminating your quarterly analyses**
- Who will be responsible for uploading data to the analytics platform? Creating the reports?

**Continued competency building and step-down**
- How would you like to practice? (e.g., solo, in a group, in regular weekly meetings?)
- Who wasn't at this training that needs to understand this content? What additional training is needed?

### Action plan structure

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Action step(s)** | List specific steps or tasks needed to achieve the objective |
| **Responsible person** | Identify the person responsible for each action step |
| **Resources needed** | Identify resources (e.g., time, materials) required for each step |
| **Timeline** | When will you complete this step? |
| **Evaluation metric** | Identify metrics or criteria to assess progress or success |

## End user mapping

End user mapping helps ensure that our outputs will meet the real needs of our end users.

### Key questions for end user mapping

1. **Who is my end user?** (e.g., head of a regional health bureau, regional health authority, national policy maker?)

2. **What does this end user need to accomplish with the report?** (E.g., make a decision, discuss in a meeting, make programmatic decisions, etc.?)

3. **Based on the information we can include in the report, what information are they most interested in? What do they need to know?** (e.g., high level trends, detailed insights, comparisons across states/regions/districts/woredas?)

4. **What do they like about current reports? What do they dislike?** (e.g., they like maps and scorecards; they dislike too much text, complex technical details)

5. **How do they like to receive their information?** (PPT, brief, key messages/bullet points, graphs, maps, dashboards?)

### User mapping example

| Question | Example Response |
|----------|------------------|
| **Who is the end user?** | Head of a regional health bureau/authority |
| **What does this end user need to accomplish with this report?** | Make a decision; Direct their team |
| **What kind of insights do they need?** | High-level trends by service and by sub-national area; Performance comparisons – who to hold accountable? |
| **What do they like about current analysis? What do they dislike?** | **Like:** actionable information, simple visuals; **Dislike:** overly technical content or content not aligned with decision-making needs |
| **How do they like to receive their information?** | Presentations at top management meeting |
| **Design implications for your output** | Short PPT with results focused only on service trends; Add actionable recommendations |
