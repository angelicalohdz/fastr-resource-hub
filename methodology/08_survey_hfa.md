# Health Facility Assessment (HFA) Phone Survey

## Background and purpose

### Objective of the module

The Health Facility Assessment (HFA) module complements routine HMIS data by collecting information directly from health facilities through phone surveys. While routine data provides continuous monitoring of service delivery volumes, phone surveys capture additional dimensions that are not available in administrative systems, including service availability, readiness, and facility-level context.

The FASTR HFA phone survey is designed to be rapid, low-cost, and regularly repeatable. By contacting facilities directly, the survey gathers timely information on operational status, staffing, supply availability, and service provision that can be triangulated with routine HMIS data to provide a more complete picture of health service delivery.

### Analytical rationale

Routine HMIS data tells us *how much* service is being delivered, but not *why* delivery patterns may be changing. Phone surveys help answer questions that routine data cannot address:

- Is a facility open and functioning?
- Are essential supplies and medicines available?
- Are trained staff present?
- What challenges are facilities facing?

By linking survey responses to routine data patterns, the FASTR approach enables more nuanced interpretation of service delivery trends.

### Key points

## Survey methodology

### Sampling approach

The FASTR HFA uses a stratified random sample of health facilities, with stratification typically based on:

1. **Geographic region** - Ensuring representation across provinces/districts
2. **Facility type** - Hospitals, health centers, health posts
3. **Ownership** - Public, private, faith-based
4. **HMIS reporting status** - Active reporters vs. non-reporters

Sample size is determined based on the precision required for key indicators and the resources available for data collection.

### Data collection

Phone surveys are conducted by trained enumerators using a standardized questionnaire. Key features include:

- **Respondent**: Facility in-charge or designated health worker
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes per facility
- **Frequency**: Quarterly or as needed
- **Quality control**: Call-backs, supervisor monitoring, data validation

### Questionnaire structure

The standard FASTR HFA questionnaire covers:

1. **Facility identification** - Verification of facility details
2. **Operational status** - Current functioning, any closures
3. **Service availability** - Which services are currently offered
4. **Staffing** - Current staff presence by cadre
5. **Essential supplies** - Stock status of key medicines and commodities
6. **Infrastructure** - Basic utilities (water, electricity)
7. **Recent challenges** - Open-ended on current issues

## Questionnaire adaptation

### Adaptation guidelines

The standard FASTR questionnaire serves as a starting point that should be adapted to each country context. Key adaptation considerations:

1. **Language** - Translation and back-translation
2. **Health system terminology** - Align with local naming conventions
3. **Indicator priorities** - Focus on nationally relevant services
4. **Skip patterns** - Adjust based on facility types in country
5. **Response options** - Match local context (e.g., supply names)

### Adaptation process

**Step 1: Review standard questionnaire**
Walk through each section with country stakeholders to identify what works and what needs modification.

**Step 2: Identify country priorities**
Determine which services and indicators are most important for the country's health objectives.

**Step 3: Modify questions**
Adapt wording, add country-specific questions, remove irrelevant items.

**Step 4: Pre-test**
Test adapted questionnaire with a small sample of facilities.

**Step 5: Finalize**
Incorporate pre-test feedback and prepare final version for training.

## Survey-routine data linkage

### Linking survey responses to HMIS data

A key feature of the FASTR approach is linking phone survey responses to routine HMIS data for the same facilities. This enables:

1. **Validation** - Check if survey-reported service availability matches HMIS reporting patterns
2. **Contextualization** - Understand *why* routine data shows certain patterns
3. **Triangulation** - Compare multiple data sources for the same facilities

### Use cases for linked analysis

- **Non-reporting facilities**: Survey confirms whether facility is closed or just not reporting
- **Service volume changes**: Survey reveals if changes are due to stockouts, staffing, or actual demand
- **Quality interpretation**: Survey data adds context to routine data quality flags

---

## Data use and decision-making

### Using HFA results

Survey results should inform:

1. **Routine data interpretation** - Explain patterns in HMIS data
2. **Targeted support** - Identify facilities needing intervention
3. **Supply chain management** - Track stockout patterns
4. **Health system strengthening** - Inform broader system improvements

### Reporting frequency

Depending on country needs and resources, HFA surveys may be conducted:
- **Quarterly** - For ongoing monitoring
- **Event-driven** - In response to specific concerns (outbreaks, emergencies)
- **Annually** - As part of routine health system assessment

## Health Facility Assessment Phone Survey

Complementing routine data with facility-level insights

---

## Survey Objectives

The FASTR HFA phone survey is designed to:

1. **Monitor** service availability, readiness, and functioning of PHC facilities over time (with emphasis on RMNCAH-N services)

2. **Characterize** and assess effect of shocks on PHC functioning

3. **Inform** and assess implementation of interventions for resilient PHC systems

4. **Enhance timeliness** by supplementing large-scale in-person surveys with a rapid-cycle phone approach

---

## Tool Design

**Framework alignment:**
- Aligned with WHO/UNICEF Primary Health Care Measurement Framework (2022)

**Question sources:**
- WHO Harmonized Health Facility Assessment
- WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA)
- World Bank Service Delivery Indicators (SDI)
- DHS Service Provision Assessment (SPA)
- USAID MOMENTUM

**Implementation:**
- Phone-based survey to facility managers/Officers in Charge
- Target duration: 30 minutes
- Quarterly contacts
- Modular design for flexibility

---

## Why phone surveys?

**Routine HMIS data tells us *what* is happening:**
- How many services were delivered
- Which facilities reported
- Where there might be data quality issues

**But HMIS data can't tell us *why*:**
- Is the facility actually open?
- Are essential supplies available?
- Are trained staff present?
- What challenges are facilities facing?

**Phone surveys fill this gap** by contacting facilities directly to understand context.

---

## What the survey covers

1. **Is the facility open and functioning?**
2. **Which services are currently available?**
3. **Are essential medicines in stock?**
4. **What staff are present today?**
5. **What challenges is the facility facing?**

Results help explain *why* routine data might show certain patterns.

## Questionnaire adaptation guidelines

---

## Why adapt the questionnaire?

The standard FASTR questionnaire is a **starting point**, not a final product.

**Every country needs to:**
- Translate into local language(s)
- Use local health system terminology
- Focus on nationally relevant indicators
- Adjust for local facility types
- Match local supply/medicine names

---

## Adaptation principles

**Keep what matters:**
- Core questions on operational status
- Essential supply availability
- Basic service provision

**Adapt to context:**
- Local terminology and naming
- Country-specific priority services
- Relevant response categories

**Don't add too much:**
- Phone surveys should stay short (15-30 min)
- Focus on actionable information
- Avoid "nice to know" questions
