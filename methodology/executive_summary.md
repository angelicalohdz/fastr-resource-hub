# Executive Summary

## FASTR RMNCAH-N Service Use Monitoring

This document describes a four-module analytical approach for monitoring reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) service delivery using routine health management information system (HMIS) data. The methodology connects to DHIS2 systems to retrieve facility-level data, applies statistical quality assessment and adjustment procedures, and generates data quality metrics, service utilization estimates, and population coverage indicators.

## Background

Health management information systems in low- and middle-income countries generate routine facility-level service delivery data on a monthly basis. However, these data are frequently affected by reporting incompleteness, statistical outliers, and internal inconsistencies that limit their analytical utility. Traditional household surveys (DHS, MICS) provide validated coverage estimates but are conducted infrequently (typically every 3-5 years), creating gaps in the availability of timely data for monitoring service delivery trends, detecting disruptions, and tracking progress toward health system goals.

This methodology addresses these constraints through a four-module analytical pipeline that systematically assesses and adjusts for data quality issues in routine HMIS data, then combines adjusted facility-level data with periodic survey benchmarks to generate continuous time series of coverage estimates at subnational geographic levels.

## Analytical Approach

### Module 1: Data Quality Assessment

Applies statistical methods to identify outliers using median absolute deviation, tracks reporting completeness at facility and indicator levels, and validates logical consistency between related indicators (e.g., ANC1 ≥ ANC4). Generates facility-level quality scores and flags for downstream use in data adjustment and analysis procedures.

### Module 2: Data Quality Adjustments

Generates four parallel versions of the dataset: (1) original unadjusted data, (2) outlier-adjusted data only, (3) missing data imputed only, and (4) both adjustments applied. Outlier adjustment replaces flagged values with 6-month rolling medians (with fallback to forward/backward fill or same-month-prior-year values). Missing data imputation follows the same hierarchical approach. All four versions are retained to support sensitivity analysis.

### Module 3: Service Utilization & Disruption Analysis

Applies statistical process control methods (control charts with robust regression) to identify months where service volumes deviate significantly from expected patterns after accounting for seasonality and trends. Uses panel regression models at national, regional, and district levels to quantify the magnitude of service shortfalls or surpluses during flagged disruption periods. Outliers identified in Module 1 are excluded from the analysis.

### Module 4: Coverage Estimation & Projection

**Part 1 - Denominators**: Calculates target population denominators by combining HMIS service counts with survey-reported coverage rates. Multiple denominator options are derived from different HMIS indicators (ANC1, deliveries, BCG, Penta1) and UN population estimates. Denominators are adjusted for biological factors including pregnancy loss, stillbirths, twin births, and mortality rates. Optimal denominators are selected per indicator by minimizing squared error between calculated coverage and survey benchmarks.

**Part 2 - Projections**: Generates coverage projections for years beyond the most recent survey by applying annual percent changes observed in HMIS data to the survey baseline. For each indicator-year-location, three values are produced: actual survey estimates where available, HMIS-anchored projections, and direct HMIS-based coverage. Analysis is conducted at national, admin area 2, and admin area 3 levels where survey data permits.

## Module Integration

The four modules operate sequentially with outputs from each module serving as inputs to subsequent stages:

- Module 2 applies quality flags generated by Module 1 to determine which observations require adjustment
- Module 3 accepts all four adjustment scenarios from Module 2 as input; users specify which scenario to apply in disruption analysis
- Module 4 Part 1 loads all four scenarios from Module 2; users specify which scenario to use as the numerator in coverage calculations
- Module 4 Part 2 loads all denominator options and coverage estimates from Part 1; users specify the preferred denominator per indicator for projection calculations

## Key Features

**Multiple Adjustment Options**: The methodology keeps four versions of adjusted data (no adjustments, outliers only, missing data only, or both). This lets you test how different data quality assumptions affect your results.

**Geographic Flexibility**: Analysis works at national and sub-national levels—as long as you have enough data and the quality is good enough for reliable estimates.

**Customizable Settings**: All thresholds, time windows, and adjustment methods can be modified to fit your country's data and context. These settings are documented in the technical specifications.
