## Introduction to FASTR

<div class="columns">
<div>

The Global Financing Facility (GFF) supports country-led efforts to strengthen the use of timely data for decision-making, with the goal of improving primary healthcare (PHC) performance and RMNCAH-N outcomes.

**Frequent Assessments and Health System Tools for Resilience (FASTR)** is the GFF's rapid-cycle analytics framework for monitoring health system performance using high-frequency data.

FASTR brings together four complementary technical approaches:

1. Routine HMIS data analysis
2. Health facility phone surveys
3. High-frequency household phone surveys
4. Follow-on, problem-driven analyses

</div>
<div>

![FASTR Technical Approaches](../resources/diagrams/Technical-Rapid-cycle-analytics--V3.svg)

</div>
</div>

---



## What FASTR does with routine HMIS data

<div class="columns">
<div>

FASTR works directly with Ministries of Health to transform routine HMIS data into actionable evidence for policy and program management.

Using facility-level data, the approach focuses on three core analytic functions:

**Assess data quality**
Identify key issues related to completeness, outliers, and internal consistency.

**Adjust for data quality limitations**
Apply transparent, indicator-specific methods to improve the reliability of trend analysis.

**Analyze service use and coverage trends**
Track changes in priority RMNCAH-N services and compare progress against country priorities and benchmarks.

</div>
<div>

![Steps to implement RMNCAH-N service use monitoring](../resources/diagrams/Steps%20to%20implement%20RMNCAH-N%20service%20chart.svg)

</div>
</div>

---



## Why rapid-cycle analytics?

<div class="columns">
<div>

Routine health information systems are a critical source of data, but they are often underused due to concerns about data quality and long delays between data collection and analysis. Traditional household and facility surveys, while essential, are resource-intensive and infrequent.

FASTR's rapid-cycle analytics address this gap by providing:

- Timely insights aligned with country decision cycles
- Continuous learning rather than one-off assessments
- Direct feedback loops between data, analysis, and action

During the COVID-19 pandemic, this approach was applied in over 20 countries to monitor disruptions to essential RMNCAH-N services and inform response and recovery planning.

</div>
<div>

![FASTR rapid-cycle analytics framework](../resources/diagrams/GFF-Rapid-Cycle-Analytics-Data-Use_Figure-1.svg)

</div>
</div>

---



## Focus of the analysis

### Core indicators

FASTR prioritizes a core set of RMNCAH-N indicators that:

- Represent key service delivery contacts across the continuum of care
- Have relatively high reporting completeness and volumes
- Serve as proxies for broader service delivery performance

Outpatient consultations are included as a proxy for overall health service use. The indicator set can be expanded to reflect country-specific priorities.

### Core data quality metrics

Analysis is anchored in a standardized set of data quality metrics, including:

- Reporting completeness
- Extreme value (outlier) detection
- Consistency across related indicators

These metrics are summarized into an overall data quality score to support interpretation and comparison across areas.

---



## FASTR approach to routine data analysis

The FASTR approach follows a three-step workflow:

### 1. Assess data quality
Identify issues related to completeness, outliers, and internal consistency at national and subnational levels.

### 2. Adjust for data quality limitations
Apply transparent, indicator-specific corrections to improve the reliability of trend analysis.

### 3. Analyze service delivery
Quantify changes in priority service volumes and compare coverage trends against country targets.

This enables continuous, subnational monitoring while data quality is systematically improved.

---



## Why extract data from DHIS2?

### Data quality adjustment

The FASTR approach focuses on data quality adjustments to expand the analyses countries can do with DHIS2 data and to generate more robust estimates.

The FASTR methodology includes specific approaches to:
- Identify and adjust for outliers
- Adjust for incomplete reporting
- Apply consistent data quality metrics

These adjustments require processing that cannot be done within DHIS2's native analytics.

---



## Tools for data extraction

*Content to be developed*

This section will cover:
- DHIS2 data export options
- API-based extraction methods
- Data transformation requirements
- Quality checks on extracted data

## Data quality assessment

Understanding the reliability of routine health data

---
## Why talk about data quality?

**The challenge:** Health facilities report data every month, but sometimes:
- Numbers seem too high or too low
- Facilities forget to report
- Related numbers don't match up

**The impact:** Bad data leads to bad decisions
- We might think services are improving when they're not
- We might miss real problems in certain areas
- Resources might go to the wrong places

**FASTR's solution:** Check data quality systematically, fix what we can, and be transparent about limitations

---
## Three simple questions about data quality

**1. Are facilities reporting regularly?**
- Completeness: Did we get reports from facilities this month?

**2. Are the numbers reasonable?**
- Outliers: Are there any suspiciously high values?

**3. Do related numbers make sense together?**
- Consistency: Do related services show expected patterns?

These three questions help us understand if we can trust the data for decision-making.

---



## Question 1: Are facilities reporting?

---

## Completeness: Did we get reports?

**What we're checking:**
Each month, are facilities sending in their reports?

**Example:**
- District has 20 health centers
- In March, only 15 sent ANC data
- **Completeness = 75%** (15 out of 20 reported)

**Why it matters:**
- If many facilities don't report, we're missing part of the picture
- Trends might look like services dropped, when really facilities just didn't report

---

## What's good completeness?

**It depends on your health system:**
- 90%+ is excellent
- 80-90% is good
- Below 80% means we're missing a lot of information

**Important:** Even 100% completeness doesn't mean we have the full picture - some services might happen outside facilities or some facilities might not be in the reporting system.

**What to look for:** Is completeness improving over time? Which areas have low completeness?

---

## Completeness: FASTR output

![Indicator Completeness](../resources/default_outputs/Default_2._Proportion_of_completed_records.png)

---



## Question 2: Are numbers reasonable?

---

## Outliers: Spotting suspicious numbers

**What we're checking:**
Are there any values that seem way too high compared to what that facility normally reports?

**Real example:**
- Health Center A normally reports 20-25 deliveries per month
- In March, they reported 450 deliveries
- **This is likely a data entry error** (maybe they typed an extra digit, or reported cumulative instead of monthly)

**Why it matters:**
- One extreme value can make it look like there was a huge service increase
- Skews totals and trends for the whole district or province

---

## How we spot outliers

Outliers are identified by assessing the within-facility variation in monthly reporting for each indicator.

A value is flagged as an outlier if it meets EITHER of two criteria:

1. A value greater than 10 times the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) from the monthly median value for the indicator, OR
2. A value for which the proportional contribution in volume for a facility, indicator, and time period is greater than 80%

AND for which the count is greater than 100.

---

## Outlier example

**Health Center B - Malaria tests:**

| Month | Tests Reported | Normal? |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| January | 245 | Normal |
| February | 267 | Normal |
| **March** | **2,890** | **Outlier** |
| April | 256 | Normal |

**What happened?** Probably someone entered "2890" instead of "289" (extra zero)

**Impact if we don't fix it:** March would show a huge "spike" in malaria that didn't really happen.

---

## Outliers: FASTR output

![Outliers](../resources/default_outputs/Default_1._Proportion_of_outliers.png)

---



## Question 3: Do related numbers match up?

---

## Consistency: Do related services make sense together?

**What we're checking:**
Health services are related - certain patterns are expected.

**Example 1 - ANC visits:**
- More women should get their **1st** ANC visit (ANC1)
- Fewer should complete all **4** visits (ANC4)
- We expect: ANC1 >= ANC4

**Example 2 - Vaccinations:**
- More babies should get their **1st** Penta dose (Penta1)
- Fewer should complete all **3** doses (Penta3)
- We expect: Penta1 >= Penta3

**If these relationships are backwards, something's wrong with the data.**

---

## Why check consistency at district level?

**Patients move between facilities:**
- Woman might get ANC1 at Health Center A
- But deliver at District Hospital B
- If we only look at each facility separately, numbers might not match

**Solution:** Check consistency at district level
- Add up all ANC1 visits in the district
- Add up all ANC4 visits in the district
- Compare the totals

This accounts for patients visiting different facilities for different services.

---

## Consistency example

**District X - ANC Services:**

| Indicator | District Total | Expected Relationship |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| ANC1 | 5,200 visits | Should be higher |
| ANC4 | 4,100 visits | Should be lower |

**This passes the consistency check** - more women started ANC (5,200) than completed 4 visits (4,100).

**If it was reversed** (more ANC4 than ANC1), we'd know there's a data quality problem.

---

## Consistency: FASTR output

![Internal Consistency](../resources/default_outputs/Default_4._Proportion_of_sub-national_areas_meeting_consistency_criteria.png)

---



## Putting it all together: Overall data quality

---

## Overall quality score

**For each facility and month, we combine all three checks:**

**Complete:** Did the facility report?
**No outliers:** Are the numbers reasonable?
**Consistent:** Do related numbers make sense?

**Binary DQA Score:**
- dqa_score = 1 if all consistency pairs pass
- dqa_score = 0 if any consistency pair fails

**DQA Mean:** Average of completeness-outlier score and consistency score

**This score helps us:**
- Decide which data to use for analysis
- Identify facilities that need support
- Track if data quality is improving over time

---

## Overall DQA score: FASTR output

# ☕ Tea Break

**15 minutes**

Back at 10:45 AM

---



## Approach to data quality adjustment

The Data Quality Adjustment module (Module 2 in the FASTR analytics platform) systematically corrects two common problems in routine health facility data:

1. **Outliers** - extreme values caused by reporting errors or data entry mistakes
2. **Missing data** - from incomplete reporting

Rather than simply deleting problematic data, this module replaces questionable values with statistically sound estimates based on each facility's own historical patterns.

---

### Four adjustment scenarios

The module produces four parallel versions of the data:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **None** | Original data, no adjustments |
| **Outliers only** | Only outlier corrections applied |
| **Completeness only** | Only missing data filled in |
| **Both** | Both types of corrections applied |

This allows analysts to understand how sensitive their results are to different data quality assumptions.

---



## Adjustment for outliers

For each value flagged as an outlier, the module calculates what the value "should have been" based on that facility's historical pattern.

**Methods used (in order of preference):**
1. Centered 6-month rolling average (3 months before + 3 months after)
2. Forward 6-month rolling average
3. Backward 6-month rolling average
4. Same month from the previous year (for seasonal indicators)
5. Facility-specific historical mean (fallback)

---

### Outlier adjustment: FASTR output

Heatmap showing percent change in service volumes due to outlier replacement.

---



## Adjustment for completeness

For months where data is missing or marked as incomplete, the module imputes (fills in) values using the same rolling average approach.

This ensures that temporary reporting gaps don't create artificial drops to zero in the data.

---

## Service utilization analysis

The Service Utilization module (Module 3 in the FASTR analytics platform) analyzes health service delivery patterns to detect and quantify disruptions in service volumes over time.

**Key capabilities:**
- Identifies when health services deviate significantly from expected patterns
- Measures magnitude of disruptions at national, provincial, and district levels
- Distinguishes normal fluctuations from genuine disruptions requiring investigation

---

### Two-stage analysis process

**Part 1: Control chart analysis**
- Model expected patterns using historical trends and seasonality
- Detect significant deviations from expected volumes
- Flag disrupted periods

**Part 2: Disruption quantification**
- Use panel regression to estimate service volume changes
- Calculate shortfalls and surpluses in absolute numbers

---



## Surplus and disruption analyses

The module detects multiple types of service disruptions:

| Disruption Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Sharp disruptions** | Single months with extreme deviations |
| **Sustained drops** | Gradual declines over several months |
| **Sustained dips** | Periods consistently below expected levels |
| **Sustained rises** | Periods consistently above expected levels |
| **Missing data patterns** | Gaps in reporting that may signal problems |

---

### Quantifying impact

Disruption analysis quantifies shortfalls and surpluses by comparing:
- **Predicted volumes** (what would have happened without disruption)
- **Actual volumes** (what was observed)

Results are reported in absolute numbers and percentages at each geographic level.

---



## Service Coverage Estimates

This module estimates health service coverage by answering: **"What percentage of the target population received this health service?"**

**Three data sources integrated:**
1. Adjusted health service volumes from HMIS
2. Population projections from United Nations
3. Household survey data from MICS/DHS

---

### Two-Part Process

**Part 1: Denominator Calculation**
- Calculate target populations using multiple methods (HMIS-based and population-based)
- Compare against survey benchmarks
- Automatically select best denominator for each indicator

**Part 2: Coverage Estimation**
- Override automatic selections based on programmatic knowledge
- Project survey estimates forward using HMIS trends
- Generate final coverage estimates
